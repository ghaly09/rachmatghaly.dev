        I started learning web development in May 2021, I&apos;ve been
        fascinated by how software works and how it can be used to solve complex
        problems and make a positive impact on people&apos;s lives. So, I
        decided to make software engineering to be my professional field.
        <br />
        Initially, I had no prior experience in web development, but I was
        determined to learn and hone my skills. To achieve this, I turned to
        various learning resources such as YouTube, Coursera, and had been
        graduated from{" "}

        There are a lot of things and technologies to learn in frontend
        development and that motivated me to explore more challenges. I enjoy
        learning something new and doing research as well as collaborating with
        small teams and big teams by getting feedback to improve myself better.

        In this website I will be writing some blogs and showcase my projects. I
        believe that writing what I have learned is the best way to remember
        things, and I can share my knowledge along the way. So do contact me and
        I will be very happy to help!
